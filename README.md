# AtomicFramework
A client side mvvm spa framework that focuses on components / re-usability oh code. Atomic: Of or forming a single irreducible unit or component in a larger system

#Why
React and even more so Web components / polymer are an amazing example of what coding can and should be. They componitize code and make it easy to handle and reuse. So why don't I push them? They by default use the default structure of the web which is a horribly nested dom. They could both , although more React than web components, use a less nested dom and use css transforms and other techniques to avoid an extremely nested dom. That isn't the same as useing a framework or library that is built to interact with the dom in that way.<br>
Right now Atomic sits on top of Famo.us, lodash, and Postal.js and adds a gestures, routing, layout and a mvvm style of coding; it also fixes some of the bugs I've found in Famo.us. The overall goal is to replace famo.us as I believe a more lightweight alternative would be ideal. Thats not in the near future though unless I win the lottery and start playing the lottery, probably not in that order.

#Future
It works and is at a point I'd like to release it but need to detach it from the project I'm useing it with and build a sample project before I give out the url and see if anyone will want to use it. So slowly over the next few weeks I'll be trying to get everything up, with examples and documentation.
